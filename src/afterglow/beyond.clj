  "Provides the ability to communicate with Pangolin's Beyond laser
  show software, including synchronizing it with Afterglow's BPM and
  beat grid, and triggering cues. This initial implementation assumes
  that sending small UDP datagrams is fast enough that it can be done
  on the caller's thread. If this turns out not to be true, it can be
  changed to use a core.async channel the way that ola-clojure does."
